# Percent, Ratio, and Money Problems

## Introduction
Have you ever noticed discounts like **20% off**, shared snacks with friends, or paid for items at a store?  
All these situations use **percent**, **ratio**, and **money math**!

In this lesson, you will learn how to:
- Compare quantities using ratios
- Find simple percentages
- Solve everyday money problems

These skills will help you make smart decisions in real life.

## Main Content

### Section 1: Understanding Ratios
A **ratio** compares two quantities.

Example:
- If there are 3 red apples and 2 oranges, the ratio of apples to oranges is:

$$
3 : 2
$$

![Illustration showing 3 apples and 2 oranges to represent a ratio](/content/grade-5/math/quarter-2/topic-percent-ratio-money/images/ratio-apples-oranges.png)

Ratios can also be written as:
- $3:2$
- $\frac{3}{2}$

#### Example:
If there are 10 boys and 15 girls in a class:
- Ratio of boys to girls = $10:15 = 2:3$

---

### Section 2: Understanding Percent
The word **percent** means *out of 100*.

Example:
$$
25\% = \frac{25}{100}
$$

![Hundred grid with 25 shaded squares to show 25 percent](/content/grade-5/math/quarter-2/topic-percent-ratio-money/images/percent-hundred-grid.png)

This picture shows **25 shaded squares out of 100**, which represents **25%**.

#### Finding Percent of a Number
To find a percent of a number:
1. Change the percent to a fraction
2. Multiply

Example:
What is 20% of 50?

$$
20\% = \frac{20}{100}
$$

$$
\frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10
$$

So, **20% of 50 is 10**.

### Section 3: Money Problems
Money problems often involve:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Making change

#### Example:
Sarah buys a notebook for \$25 and gives the cashier \$50.

![Cashier giving change after a customer pays with a large bill](/content/grade-5/math/quarter-2/topic-percent-ratio-money/images/money-change-example.png)

$$
50 - 25 = 25
$$

Sarah gets **\$25** as change.

## Using Percent in Real Life: Sales and Discounts
Percent is often used in stores to show discounts.

![Price tag showing 20 percent discount during a sale](/content/grade-5/math/quarter-2/topic-percent-ratio-money/images/discount-shopping-tag.png)

If an item costs \$100 and is **20% off**, the discount is:

$$
20\% \times 100 = 20
$$

So, the new price is:

$$
100 - 20 = 80
$$

## Formulas

| Concept | Formula |
|-------|--------|
| Ratio | $a:b$ |
| Percent | $\frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \times 100$ |
| Change | $\text{Money Given} - \text{Cost}$ |

## Examples

### Example 1: Ratio
There are 4 cats and 6 dogs.  
Ratio of cats to dogs:

$$
4:6 = 2:3
$$

### Example 2: Percent
What is 10% of 80?

$$
\frac{10}{100} \times 80 = 8
$$

### Example 3: Money
A toy costs \$35. You pay \$100.

$$
100 - 35 = 65
$$
