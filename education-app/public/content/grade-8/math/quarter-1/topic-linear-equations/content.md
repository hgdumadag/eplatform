# Linear Equations

## Introduction

Have you ever wondered how to find an unknown number in a mathematical sentence? That's exactly what solving equations is all about! Linear equations are one of the most fundamental concepts in algebra, and they're used everywhere - from calculating your phone bill to predicting the weather.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to solve different types of linear equations and see how they apply to everyday situations. By the end, you'll be able to tackle equations like a pro!

## What is a Linear Equation?

A **linear equation** is an equation where the highest power of the variable is 1. In other words, there are no exponents like $x^2$ or $x^3$ - just plain $x$.

Examples of linear equations:
- $3x + 5 = 14$
- $2y - 7 = 11$
- $4a + 3 = 2a + 9$

The **solution** to an equation is the value of the variable that makes the equation true.

## Properties of Equality

When solving equations, we use these important properties:

1. **Addition Property**: If $a = b$, then $a + c = b + c$
2. **Subtraction Property**: If $a = b$, then $a - c = b - c$
3. **Multiplication Property**: If $a = b$, then $a \times c = b \times c$
4. **Division Property**: If $a = b$, then $\frac{a}{c} = \frac{b}{c}$ (where $c \neq 0$)

**Key Principle**: Whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other side!

## Solving Linear Equations

### One-Step Equations

These equations require only one operation to solve.

**Strategy**: Use the inverse operation to isolate the variable.

### Multi-Step Equations

These equations require multiple operations to solve.

**General Steps:**
1. Simplify both sides (distribute and combine like terms)
2. Get all variable terms on one side
3. Get all constant terms on the other side
4. Solve for the variable
5. Check your solution

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: One-Step Equation (Addition/Subtraction)

**Problem:** Solve $x - 8 = 15$

**Solution:**

Step 1: Add 8 to both sides to isolate $x$
$$x - 8 + 8 = 15 + 8$$
$$x = 23$$

Step 2: Check the solution
$$23 - 8 = 15$$ ✓

**Answer:** $x = 23$

### Example 2: One-Step Equation (Multiplication/Division)

**Problem:** Solve $5y = 35$

**Solution:**

Step 1: Divide both sides by 5
$$\frac{5y}{5} = \frac{35}{5}$$
$$y = 7$$

Step 2: Check the solution
$$5(7) = 35$$ ✓

**Answer:** $y = 7$

### Example 3: Multi-Step Equation

**Problem:** Solve $3x + 7 = 22$

**Solution:**

Step 1: Subtract 7 from both sides
$$3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7$$
$$3x = 15$$

Step 2: Divide both sides by 3
$$\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}$$
$$x = 5$$

Step 3: Check the solution
$$3(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22$$ ✓

**Answer:** $x = 5$

### Example 4: Equation with Variables on Both Sides

**Problem:** Solve $5x - 3 = 2x + 9$

**Solution:**

Step 1: Subtract $2x$ from both sides to get variables on one side
$$5x - 2x - 3 = 2x - 2x + 9$$
$$3x - 3 = 9$$

Step 2: Add 3 to both sides
$$3x - 3 + 3 = 9 + 3$$
$$3x = 12$$

Step 3: Divide both sides by 3
$$x = 4$$

Step 4: Check the solution
$$5(4) - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17$$
$$2(4) + 9 = 8 + 9 = 17$$ ✓

**Answer:** $x = 4$

### Example 5: Equation with Distributive Property

**Problem:** Solve $2(x + 4) = 18$

**Solution:**

Step 1: Apply the distributive property
$$2 \cdot x + 2 \cdot 4 = 18$$
$$2x + 8 = 18$$

Step 2: Subtract 8 from both sides
$$2x = 10$$

Step 3: Divide both sides by 2
$$x = 5$$

Step 4: Check the solution
$$2(5 + 4) = 2(9) = 18$$ ✓

**Answer:** $x = 5$

### Example 6: Real-World Word Problem

**Problem:** Maria has \$50. She buys a book for \$12 and some pens that cost \$3 each. If she has \$20 left, how many pens did she buy?

**Solution:**

Step 1: Set up the equation
Let $p$ = number of pens

Starting money - book cost - pen cost = money left
$$50 - 12 - 3p = 20$$

Step 2: Simplify
$$38 - 3p = 20$$

Step 3: Subtract 38 from both sides
$$-3p = 20 - 38$$
$$-3p = -18$$

Step 4: Divide both sides by -3
$$p = 6$$

Step 5: Check the solution
$$50 - 12 - 3(6) = 50 - 12 - 18 = 20$$ ✓

**Answer:** Maria bought 6 pens.

## Graphing Linear Equations

Linear equations in two variables (like $y = 2x + 3$) can be graphed on a coordinate plane. The graph is always a straight line.

**Slope-Intercept Form:** $y = mx + b$
- $m$ is the slope (how steep the line is)
- $b$ is the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis)

**Example:** The equation $y = 2x + 1$ has:
- Slope = 2 (rises 2 units for every 1 unit to the right)
- Y-intercept = 1 (crosses the y-axis at the point (0, 1))

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting to apply operations to both sides** - Always maintain balance!
2. **Sign errors** - Be careful with negative numbers
3. **Not simplifying before solving** - Combine like terms first
4. **Division by zero** - Never divide by zero
5. **Not checking your answer** - Always substitute back to verify

## Key Takeaways

1. **Linear equations** have variables with power 1 only
2. **Use inverse operations** to isolate the variable
3. **Whatever you do to one side, do to the other** - maintain equality
4. **Follow the order**: Simplify → Combine → Isolate → Solve
5. **Always check your answer** by substituting back into the original equation
6. **Word problems**: Read carefully, identify the variable, set up the equation, then solve
7. **Graphing**: Linear equations produce straight lines on the coordinate plane
