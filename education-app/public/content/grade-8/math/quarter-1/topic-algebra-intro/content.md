# Introduction

Welcome to the world of algebra!

Algebra is like a puzzle-solving language for mathematics. Instead of always working with known numbers, algebra lets us work with unknowns represented by letters. This powerful tool allows us to solve real-world problems, from calculating costs to predicting trends.

Think of algebra as a way to express patterns and relationships. When you say "I'm thinking of a number, and when I double it and add 3, I get 11" - algebra helps us find that mystery number!

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- What variables are and how they work
- How to write algebraic expressions
- The difference between expressions and equations
- How to solve linear equations
- How to apply algebra to real-world problems

# Main Content

## What are Variables?

A **variable** is a letter (like $x$, $y$, or $n$) that represents an unknown number or a number that can change.

For example:
- Let $x$ = the number of hours you study
- Let $p$ = the price of a ticket
- Let $n$ = any whole number

Variables allow us to write general rules and solve for unknowns.

## Algebraic Expressions

An **algebraic expression** is a combination of numbers, variables, and operations (like $+$, $-$, $\times$, $\div$).

Examples:
- $3x + 5$ (three times x, plus five)
- $2y - 7$ (two times y, minus seven)
- $\frac{n}{4} + 2$ (n divided by four, plus two)

**Important**: An expression doesn't have an equals sign. It's like a phrase, not a complete sentence.

## Terms, Coefficients, and Constants

In the expression $5x + 3$:
- **Terms**: Parts separated by $+$ or $-$ signs ($5x$ and $3$)
- **Coefficient**: The number multiplied by a variable ($5$ in $5x$)
- **Constant**: A term without a variable ($3$)
- **Variable**: The letter representing an unknown ($x$)

## Algebraic Equations

An **equation** is a mathematical statement that says two expressions are equal. It always has an equals sign ($=$).

Examples:
- $x + 7 = 12$ (x plus seven equals twelve)
- $3n - 4 = 11$ (three n minus four equals eleven)
- $\frac{y}{2} = 5$ (y divided by two equals five)

Our goal with equations is to **solve** them - to find the value of the variable that makes the equation true.

## Properties of Equality

These properties help us solve equations:

**Addition Property**: Add the same number to both sides
$$\text{If } a = b, \text{ then } a + c = b + c$$

**Subtraction Property**: Subtract the same number from both sides
$$\text{If } a = b, \text{ then } a - c = b - c$$

**Multiplication Property**: Multiply both sides by the same number
$$\text{If } a = b, \text{ then } a \times c = b \times c$$

**Division Property**: Divide both sides by the same non-zero number
$$\text{If } a = b, \text{ then } \frac{a}{c} = \frac{b}{c}$$

**Key Idea**: Whatever you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other side to keep it balanced!

## Solving One-Step Equations

To solve an equation, isolate the variable on one side using inverse operations:

- If something is **added**, **subtract** it from both sides
- If something is **subtracted**, **add** it to both sides
- If something is **multiplied**, **divide** both sides by it
- If something is **divided**, **multiply** both sides by it

## Solving Two-Step Equations

For equations like $2x + 3 = 11$, use two steps:
1. **Undo addition/subtraction first** (add or subtract)
2. **Then undo multiplication/division** (multiply or divide)

Think of it as "unwrapping" the variable in reverse order!

## Checking Your Solution

Always check your answer by substituting it back into the original equation:

If $x = 5$ is your solution to $2x + 3 = 13$, check:
$$2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13$$ ✓

# Formulas

## One-Step Equations

**Addition:**
$$x + a = b \implies x = b - a$$

**Subtraction:**
$$x - a = b \implies x = b + a$$

**Multiplication:**
$$ax = b \implies x = \frac{b}{a}$$

**Division:**
$$\frac{x}{a} = b \implies x = ab$$

## Two-Step Equation Formula

For equations in the form $ax + b = c$:

$$ax + b = c$$
$$ax = c - b$$
$$x = \frac{c - b}{a}$$

# Examples

## Example 1: Writing Expressions

**Problem:** Write an algebraic expression for "five more than twice a number."

**Solution:**
- Let $n$ = the number
- "Twice a number" = $2n$
- "Five more than" = add 5

**Answer: $2n + 5$**

## Example 2: Evaluating Expressions

**Problem:** Evaluate $3x - 7$ when $x = 5$

**Solution:**
Substitute $x = 5$:
$$3(5) - 7 = 15 - 7 = 8$$

**Answer: 8**

## Example 3: Solving One-Step Equations (Addition)

**Problem:** Solve $x + 9 = 15$

**Solution:**
Subtract 9 from both sides:
$$x + 9 - 9 = 15 - 9$$
$$x = 6$$

**Check:** $6 + 9 = 15$ ✓

**Answer: $x = 6$**

## Example 4: Solving One-Step Equations (Multiplication)

**Problem:** Solve $4x = 28$

**Solution:**
Divide both sides by 4:
$$\frac{4x}{4} = \frac{28}{4}$$
$$x = 7$$

**Check:** $4(7) = 28$ ✓

**Answer: $x = 7$**

## Example 5: Solving Two-Step Equations

**Problem:** Solve $3x + 5 = 20$

**Solution:**
Step 1: Subtract 5 from both sides
$$3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5$$
$$3x = 15$$

Step 2: Divide both sides by 3
$$\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}$$
$$x = 5$$

**Check:** $3(5) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20$ ✓

**Answer: $x = 5$**

## Example 6: Word Problem

**Problem:** Maria has some money. She spent $15 on lunch and has $32 left. How much money did she start with?

**Solution:**
Let $x$ = money Maria started with

She spent $15, so she has $x - 15$ left:
$$x - 15 = 32$$

Add 15 to both sides:
$$x - 15 + 15 = 32 + 15$$
$$x = 47$$

**Answer: Maria started with $47**

## Example 7: More Complex Two-Step Equation

**Problem:** Solve $\frac{x}{3} + 7 = 12$

**Solution:**
Step 1: Subtract 7 from both sides
$$\frac{x}{3} + 7 - 7 = 12 - 7$$
$$\frac{x}{3} = 5$$

Step 2: Multiply both sides by 3
$$3 \times \frac{x}{3} = 5 \times 3$$
$$x = 15$$

**Check:** $\frac{15}{3} + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12$ ✓

**Answer: $x = 15$**

# Key Takeaways

Remember these essential algebra concepts:

- **Variables are letters that represent unknown numbers** - they're the building blocks of algebra
- **Expressions** don't have equals signs; **equations** do
- An equation is like a balanced scale - **keep both sides equal**
- Use **inverse operations** to solve equations (addition ↔ subtraction, multiplication ↔ division)
- For two-step equations, **undo addition/subtraction first, then multiplication/division**
- **Always check your solution** by substituting it back into the original equation
- The goal is to **isolate the variable** - get it alone on one side of the equation
- In $5x + 3$, the **coefficient** is 5, the **variable** is x, and the **constant** is 3
- Whatever operation you perform on one side, **do it to the other side too**

Algebra is a fundamental skill that opens doors to advanced mathematics and real-world problem-solving. With practice, these concepts will become second nature. Keep solving equations, and you'll build confidence and skill!
