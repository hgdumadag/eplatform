      "options": ["3", "5", "8", "x"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The coefficient is the number multiplied by the variable. In $5x + 3$, the coefficient of $x$ is 5.",

      "options": ["7", "-4", "y", "3"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A constant is a term without a variable. In $7y - 4$, the constant is -4.",

      "options": ["4", "6", "24", "15"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Subtract 9 from both sides: $x + 9 - 9 = 15 - 9$, so $x = 6$.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Divide both sides by 4: $\\frac{4x}{4} = \\frac{28}{4}$, so $x = 7$.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "\"Twice a number\" is $2n$, and \"five more than\" means add 5, giving $2n + 5$. Note that $2n + 5$ and $5 + 2n$ are both correct (commutative property), but $2n + 5$ matches the word order.",
