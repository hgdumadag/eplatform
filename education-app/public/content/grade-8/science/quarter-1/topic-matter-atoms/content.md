# Matter & Atoms

## Introduction

Everything around you—the air you breathe, the water you drink, the chair you sit on—is made of matter. But what exactly is matter made of? The answer lies in tiny particles called atoms, the fundamental building blocks of everything in the universe.

Understanding atoms helps us explain why different materials have different properties, how chemical reactions occur, and even how stars form in space. In this lesson, we'll explore the fascinating world of atoms and discover how they combine to create the incredible diversity of matter we see around us.

## Main Content

### 1. What is Matter?

**Matter** is anything that has mass and takes up space. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.

#### Properties of Matter
- **Mass**: The amount of matter in an object
- **Volume**: The amount of space an object occupies
- **Density**: Mass per unit volume ($\rho = \frac{m}{V}$)

### 2. States of Matter

Matter exists in different states, each with unique properties:

#### Solid
- Definite shape and volume
- Particles are tightly packed and vibrate in place
- Strong attractive forces between particles
- Examples: ice, rock, metal

#### Liquid
- Definite volume but takes the shape of its container
- Particles are close but can move past each other
- Moderate attractive forces
- Examples: water, milk, juice

#### Gas
- No definite shape or volume
- Particles are far apart and move freely
- Weak attractive forces
- Examples: air, oxygen, carbon dioxide

#### Plasma
- High-energy state with charged particles
- Found in stars, lightning, and fluorescent lights

### 3. Structure of the Atom

An atom is the smallest unit of an element that retains the properties of that element.

#### Subatomic Particles

**Protons**
- Positively charged (+1)
- Located in the nucleus
- Mass: approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu)
- Number of protons = atomic number

**Neutrons**
- No charge (neutral)
- Located in the nucleus
- Mass: approximately 1 amu
- Protons + neutrons = mass number

**Electrons**
- Negatively charged (-1)
- Orbit the nucleus in electron shells or clouds
- Mass: approximately 1/2000 amu (negligible)
- Number of electrons = number of protons (in neutral atoms)

#### The Nucleus
The nucleus is the dense center of the atom containing protons and neutrons. It contains almost all the atom's mass but occupies very little space.

### 4. Atomic Number and Mass Number

**Atomic Number (Z)**: The number of protons in an atom's nucleus
- Identifies the element
- Example: Carbon has 6 protons, so its atomic number is 6

**Mass Number (A)**: The total number of protons and neutrons
- Mass number = protons + neutrons
- Example: Carbon-12 has 6 protons + 6 neutrons = mass number 12

**Notation:**
$$^{A}_{Z}\text{Element Symbol}$$

Example: $^{12}_{6}\text{C}$ (Carbon-12)

### 5. Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures

#### Elements
- Pure substances made of only one type of atom
- Cannot be broken down by chemical means
- Examples: Oxygen (O), Gold (Au), Hydrogen (H)
- 118 known elements

#### Compounds
- Pure substances made of two or more elements chemically bonded
- Have different properties than their component elements
- Fixed ratio of elements
- Examples: Water (H₂O), Carbon dioxide (CO₂), Salt (NaCl)

#### Mixtures
- Two or more substances physically combined
- Can be separated by physical means
- Components retain their properties
- Examples: Air, saltwater, trail mix

### 6. The Periodic Table

The periodic table organizes all known elements based on their properties.

#### Organization:
- **Rows (Periods)**: Numbered 1-7, represent electron shells
- **Columns (Groups)**: Numbered 1-18, elements with similar properties
- **Metals**: Left side and center, good conductors, shiny, malleable
- **Nonmetals**: Right side, poor conductors, dull, brittle
- **Metalloids**: Along the "staircase," properties between metals and nonmetals

#### Important Groups:
- **Group 1**: Alkali metals (highly reactive)
- **Group 2**: Alkaline earth metals
- **Group 17**: Halogens (very reactive nonmetals)
- **Group 18**: Noble gases (unreactive, stable)

### 7. Chemical Formulas

Chemical formulas show the types and numbers of atoms in a compound:
- H₂O: 2 hydrogen atoms, 1 oxygen atom
- CO₂: 1 carbon atom, 2 oxygen atoms
- NaCl: 1 sodium atom, 1 chlorine atom

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Calculating Neutrons

**Problem:** Carbon-14 has an atomic number of 6. How many neutrons does it have?

**Solution:**
- Atomic number (Z) = 6 (number of protons)
- Mass number (A) = 14
- Neutrons = Mass number - Atomic number
- Neutrons = 14 - 6 = 8

**Answer:** Carbon-14 has 8 neutrons.

### Example 2: Identifying Subatomic Particles

**Problem:** An atom has 11 protons, 12 neutrons, and 11 electrons. What is the element, and what are its atomic and mass numbers?

**Solution:**
- Number of protons = 11, so atomic number = 11
- Looking at the periodic table, element 11 is Sodium (Na)
- Mass number = protons + neutrons = 11 + 12 = 23
- Since protons = electrons, the atom is neutral

**Answer:** The element is Sodium-23 (Na-23), with atomic number 11 and mass number 23.

### Example 3: Element or Compound?

**Problem:** Classify the following as elements or compounds:
a) O₂ (oxygen gas)
b) H₂O (water)
c) Fe (iron)
d) CO₂ (carbon dioxide)

**Solution:**
- **Element**: Made of only one type of atom
- **Compound**: Made of two or more types of atoms chemically bonded

a) O₂: Element (two oxygen atoms bonded together)
b) H₂O: Compound (hydrogen and oxygen atoms)
c) Fe: Element (iron atoms)
d) CO₂: Compound (carbon and oxygen atoms)

**Answer:** Elements: O₂ and Fe; Compounds: H₂O and CO₂

### Example 4: Counting Atoms

**Problem:** How many total atoms are in one molecule of glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆)?

**Solution:**
- C₆: 6 carbon atoms
- H₁₂: 12 hydrogen atoms
- O₆: 6 oxygen atoms
- Total = 6 + 12 + 6 = 24 atoms

**Answer:** One molecule of glucose contains 24 atoms.

### Example 5: Density Calculation

**Problem:** A block of aluminum has a mass of 135 g and a volume of 50 cm³. What is its density?

**Solution:**
- Formula: $\rho = \frac{m}{V}$
- Given: m = 135 g, V = 50 cm³
- $\rho = \frac{135 \text{ g}}{50 \text{ cm}^3} = 2.7 \text{ g/cm}^3$

**Answer:** The density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm³.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Matter** is anything with mass and volume, made up of atoms.

2. The three common states of matter are **solid, liquid, and gas**, each with distinct properties based on particle arrangement and movement.

3. **Atoms** consist of three subatomic particles: protons (positive), neutrons (neutral), and electrons (negative).

4. The **atomic number** equals the number of protons and identifies the element. The **mass number** is the sum of protons and neutrons.

5. **Elements** are pure substances made of one type of atom, while **compounds** contain two or more types of atoms chemically bonded.

6. **Mixtures** are physical combinations of substances that can be separated without chemical reactions.

7. The **periodic table** organizes elements by their properties, with metals on the left, nonmetals on the right, and metalloids in between.

8. **Chemical formulas** use element symbols and subscript numbers to show the composition of compounds.
