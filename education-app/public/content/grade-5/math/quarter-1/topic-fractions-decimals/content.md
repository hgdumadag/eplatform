# Fractions & Decimals

## Introduction

Welcome to the wonderful world of fractions and decimals! Have you ever shared a pizza with friends or used money to buy something? Then you've already used fractions and decimals in real life!

Fractions help us describe parts of a whole, like half a cookie or a quarter of an hour. Decimals are another way to write parts of a whole, especially when dealing with money or measurements. In this lesson, you'll learn how these two concepts are connected and how to use them confidently.

## What are Fractions?

A **fraction** represents part of a whole. It has two parts:

$$\frac{\text{numerator}}{\text{denominator}}$$

- The **numerator** (top number) tells us how many parts we have
- The **denominator** (bottom number) tells us how many equal parts make up the whole

**Example:** In the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$:
- Numerator = 3 (we have 3 parts)
- Denominator = 4 (the whole is divided into 4 equal parts)
- This means "3 out of 4 parts" or "three-fourths"

### Types of Fractions

1. **Proper Fraction**: Numerator < Denominator (like $\frac{2}{5}$)
2. **Improper Fraction**: Numerator ≥ Denominator (like $\frac{7}{4}$)
3. **Mixed Number**: A whole number plus a fraction (like $2\frac{1}{3}$)

## What are Decimals?

A **decimal** is another way to represent parts of a whole using place value. The decimal point separates the whole number part from the fractional part.

**Example:** In the decimal 3.75:
- 3 is the whole number part
- The decimal point separates whole from parts
- 7 is in the tenths place (means $\frac{7}{10}$)
- 5 is in the hundredths place (means $\frac{5}{100}$)

### Decimal Place Values

| Hundreds | Tens | Ones | . | Tenths | Hundredths | Thousandths |
|----------|------|------|---|--------|------------|-------------|
| 100      | 10   | 1    | . | 0.1    | 0.01       | 0.001       |

## Converting Between Fractions and Decimals

### Fraction to Decimal

**Method:** Divide the numerator by the denominator.

**Example:** Convert $\frac{3}{4}$ to a decimal
$$\frac{3}{4} = 3 \div 4 = 0.75$$

### Decimal to Fraction

**Method:** Use the place value.

**Example:** Convert 0.6 to a fraction
- 0.6 means 6 tenths
- Write as $\frac{6}{10}$
- Simplify: $\frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$

## Comparing Fractions and Decimals

### Comparing Fractions

**Method 1: Same Denominator** - Compare numerators
- $\frac{3}{8} < \frac{5}{8}$ (because 3 < 5)

**Method 2: Convert to Decimals** - Compare the decimal values
- $\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$ and $\frac{1}{3} = 0.333...$
- So $\frac{1}{4} < \frac{1}{3}$

### Comparing Decimals

**Method:** Compare digit by digit from left to right
- Compare ones place first
- Then tenths place
- Then hundredths place, and so on

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Understanding Fractions

**Problem:** Sarah ate 3 slices of a pizza that was cut into 8 equal slices. What fraction of the pizza did she eat?

**Solution:**

Sarah ate 3 out of 8 slices, so:
$$\text{Fraction eaten} = \frac{3}{8}$$

**Answer:** Sarah ate $\frac{3}{8}$ of the pizza.

### Example 2: Converting Fraction to Decimal

**Problem:** Convert $\frac{1}{2}$ to a decimal.

**Solution:**

Divide the numerator by the denominator:
$$\frac{1}{2} = 1 \div 2 = 0.5$$

**Answer:** $\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$

### Example 3: Converting Decimal to Fraction

**Problem:** Convert 0.75 to a fraction.

**Solution:**

Step 1: 0.75 means 75 hundredths
$$0.75 = \frac{75}{100}$$

Step 2: Simplify by dividing both parts by 25
$$\frac{75}{100} = \frac{75 \div 25}{100 \div 25} = \frac{3}{4}$$

**Answer:** $0.75 = \frac{3}{4}$

### Example 4: Comparing Fractions

**Problem:** Which is larger: $\frac{2}{5}$ or $\frac{3}{10}$?

**Solution:**

Method: Convert both to decimals
$$\frac{2}{5} = 2 \div 5 = 0.4$$
$$\frac{3}{10} = 3 \div 10 = 0.3$$

Since 0.4 > 0.3, we know $\frac{2}{5} > \frac{3}{10}$

**Answer:** $\frac{2}{5}$ is larger.

### Example 5: Comparing Decimals

**Problem:** Order these decimals from smallest to largest: 0.8, 0.75, 0.805

**Solution:**

Step 1: Line up the decimal points and compare
- 0.800
- 0.750
- 0.805

Step 2: Compare tenths place: all have 7 or 8
- 0.750 has 7 tenths (smallest)
- 0.800 and 0.805 both have 8 tenths

Step 3: Compare hundredths place for 0.800 and 0.805
- 0.800 has 0 hundredths
- 0.805 has 0 hundredths (same), so check thousandths
- 0.800 has 0 thousandths
- 0.805 has 5 thousandths (larger)

**Answer:** 0.75, 0.8, 0.805

### Example 6: Adding Fractions with Like Denominators

**Problem:** Add $\frac{2}{7} + \frac{3}{7}$

**Solution:**

When denominators are the same, just add the numerators:
$$\frac{2}{7} + \frac{3}{7} = \frac{2 + 3}{7} = \frac{5}{7}$$

**Answer:** $\frac{5}{7}$

## Common Equivalent Fractions and Decimals

Here are some useful conversions to remember:

| Fraction | Decimal |
|----------|---------|
| $\frac{1}{2}$ | 0.5 |
| $\frac{1}{4}$ | 0.25 |
| $\frac{3}{4}$ | 0.75 |
| $\frac{1}{5}$ | 0.2 |
| $\frac{1}{10}$ | 0.1 |
| $\frac{1}{100}$ | 0.01 |

## Real-Life Applications

1. **Money**: $0.25 = \frac{1}{4}$ of a dollar = 25 cents
2. **Measurements**: Half a meter = $\frac{1}{2}$ m = 0.5 m
3. **Cooking**: $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of sugar
4. **Time**: Quarter past the hour = $\frac{1}{4}$ hour = 0.25 hours = 15 minutes
5. **Grades**: Getting 18 out of 20 questions right = $\frac{18}{20} = \frac{9}{10}$ = 0.9 = 90%

## Key Takeaways

1. **Fractions** show parts of a whole using numerator and denominator
2. **Decimals** also show parts of a whole using place value
3. **To convert fraction to decimal**: Divide numerator by denominator
4. **To convert decimal to fraction**: Use place value, then simplify
5. **To compare fractions**: Convert to decimals or find common denominators
6. **To compare decimals**: Compare digit by digit from left to right
7. **Money is decimal**: $0.50 = \frac{50}{100} = \frac{1}{2}$ dollar
8. **Practice makes perfect**: The more you work with fractions and decimals, the easier they become!

## Tips and Tricks

- When adding or subtracting fractions, the denominators must be the same
- To simplify a fraction, divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor
- When comparing decimals, you can add zeros to the end without changing the value (0.5 = 0.50 = 0.500)
- Use benchmarks like $\frac{1}{2}$ (0.5) to help estimate and compare
