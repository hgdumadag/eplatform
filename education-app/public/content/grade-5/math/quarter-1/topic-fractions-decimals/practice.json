        "0.4",
        "0.5",
        "0.14"

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "To convert $\\frac{1}{4}$ to a decimal, divide 1 by 4: $1 \\div 4 = 0.25$.",

      "correctAnswer": "true",
      "explanation": "Converting to decimals: $\\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$ and $\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$. Since 0.6 > 0.5, the statement is true.",

      "correctAnswer": "4/5",
      "explanation": "0.8 means 8 tenths: $\\frac{8}{10}$. Simplifying by dividing both by 2: $\\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}$.",

      "explanation": "When denominators are the same, add the numerators: $\\frac{2+4}{9} = \\frac{6}{9}$ (which can simplify to $\\frac{2}{3}$, but $\\frac{6}{9}$ is also correct).",
