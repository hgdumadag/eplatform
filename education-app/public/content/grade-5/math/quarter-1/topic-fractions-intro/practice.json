    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "In the fraction $\\frac{3}{4}$, which number is the numerator?",
      "options": ["3", "4", "7", "12"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The numerator is the top number of a fraction. In $\\frac{3}{4}$, the numerator is 3.",

      "id": "q2",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What does the denominator of a fraction tell us?",
      "options": ["How many parts we have", "How many equal parts the whole is divided into", "The total number", "The sum of the fraction"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The denominator (bottom number) tells us how many equal parts the whole is divided into.",

      "id": "q3",
      "type": "multiple-choice",

      "options": ["$\\frac{1}{4}$", "$\\frac{2}{3}$", "$\\frac{2}{4}$", "$\\frac{3}{5}$"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "To find an equivalent fraction, multiply both numerator and denominator by the same number. $\\frac{1 \\times 2}{2 \\times 2} = \\frac{2}{4}$",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "When fractions have the same denominator, compare the numerators. Since 7 > 5, we have $\\frac{7}{9} > \\frac{5}{9}$.",
