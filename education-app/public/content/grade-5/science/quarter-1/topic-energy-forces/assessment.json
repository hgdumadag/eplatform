    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "A book sitting on a high shelf has what type of energy?",
      "options": ["Kinetic energy", "Sound energy", "Potential energy", "Light energy"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The book has potential energy because it is at a height. If it falls, the potential energy will become kinetic energy.",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Balanced forces cause objects to change speed or direction.",
      "correctAnswer": "false",
      "explanation": "Balanced forces are equal and opposite, so they cancel out and don't cause changes in motion. Unbalanced forces cause changes in speed or direction.",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What energy transformation happens when you eat food and then ride your bike?",
      "options": ["Light to kinetic", "Chemical to kinetic", "Potential to light", "Sound to heat"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Food contains chemical energy, which your body transforms into kinetic energy (motion) when you ride your bike.",
      "points": 15
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "type": "fill-in",
      "question": "The force that opposes motion and slows things down is called _______.",
      "correctAnswer": "friction",
      "explanation": "Friction is the force that occurs when surfaces rub together, and it always opposes motion.",
      "points": 15
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which surface would create the MOST friction?",
      "options": ["Ice", "Smooth tile", "Sandpaper", "Glass"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Sandpaper is very rough, so it creates the most friction. Smoother surfaces like ice and glass create less friction.",
      "points": 15
    },
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "A car moving down the road has both kinetic energy and potential energy.",
      "correctAnswer": "true",
      "explanation": "The car has kinetic energy because it's moving. It also has potential energy based on its height above ground level (even if it's small).",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q7",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What must happen for an object at rest to start moving?",
      "options": ["Balanced forces must act on it", "Unbalanced forces must act on it", "Gravity must stop working", "Friction must increase"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "An unbalanced force (where one force is stronger than others) is needed to start an object moving or change its motion.",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q8",
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "A ball rolls down a ramp. Describe the energy transformation that occurs.",
      "correctAnswer": "Potential energy changes to kinetic energy",
      "explanation": "At the top, the ball has potential energy from its height. As it rolls down, the potential energy transforms into kinetic energy (motion).",
