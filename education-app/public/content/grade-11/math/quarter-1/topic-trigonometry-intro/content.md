# Introduction

Welcome to trigonometry - the mathematics of triangles and circles!

Trigonometry (from Greek: "triangle measurement") is one of the most practical branches of mathematics. It's used by engineers to design buildings, by pilots to navigate aircraft, by astronomers to measure distances to stars, and by video game developers to create realistic 3D graphics.

At its core, trigonometry studies the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles. These relationships turn out to be incredibly useful for solving real-world problems involving heights, distances, angles, and periodic phenomena like waves and oscillations.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- The six trigonometric ratios and what they mean
- How to use SOH-CAH-TOA for right triangles
- How to find missing sides and angles
- The basics of the unit circle
- Real-world applications of trigonometry

## Right Triangles Refresher

A **right triangle** has:
- One **right angle** (90°)
- Two **acute angles** (less than 90°)
- A **hypotenuse** - the longest side, opposite the right angle
- Two **legs** - the sides that form the right angle

The sum of all angles in any triangle is 180°.

## The Three Primary Trigonometric Ratios

For a given acute angle $\theta$ (theta) in a right triangle, we define three fundamental ratios:

### Sine (sin)
$$\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$$

The sine of an angle is the ratio of the side opposite to the angle divided by the hypotenuse.

### Cosine (cos)
$$\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$$

The cosine of an angle is the ratio of the side adjacent to the angle divided by the hypotenuse.

### Tangent (tan)
$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$$

The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the side opposite to the angle divided by the side adjacent to it.

## SOH-CAH-TOA

This mnemonic helps you remember the three ratios:

- **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse
- **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse
- **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent

This is your most important trigonometry tool!

## The Three Reciprocal Ratios

For completeness, there are three additional ratios (reciprocals of the primary ones):

### Cosecant (csc)
$$\csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)} = \frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{opposite}}$$

### Secant (sec)
$$\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{adjacent}}$$

### Cotangent (cot)
$$\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{opposite}}$$

## Special Right Triangles

### 45-45-90 Triangle
- Angles: 45°, 45°, 90°
- Sides ratio: $1 : 1 : \sqrt{2}$
- $\sin(45°) = \cos(45°) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
- $\tan(45°) = 1$

### 30-60-90 Triangle
- Angles: 30°, 60°, 90°
- Sides ratio: $1 : \sqrt{3} : 2$
- $\sin(30°) = \frac{1}{2}$, $\cos(30°) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
- $\sin(60°) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $\cos(60°) = \frac{1}{2}$

## The Unit Circle

The **unit circle** is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin of a coordinate plane.

For any angle $\theta$ measured from the positive x-axis:
- The x-coordinate of the point on the circle is $\cos(\theta)$
- The y-coordinate of the point on the circle is $\sin(\theta)$

This powerful connection links trigonometry to the coordinate plane and extends trig functions beyond right triangles!

## Inverse Trigonometric Functions

Sometimes we know the ratio and need to find the angle. That's where inverse trig functions come in:

- $\sin^{-1}(x)$ or $\arcsin(x)$ - finds the angle whose sine is $x$
- $\cos^{-1}(x)$ or $\arccos(x)$ - finds the angle whose cosine is $x$
- $\tan^{-1}(x)$ or $\arctan(x)$ - finds the angle whose tangent is $x$

Most calculators have these functions (usually labeled sin⁻¹, cos⁻¹, tan⁻¹).

## The Pythagorean Identity

One of the most important relationships in trigonometry:

$$\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$$

This comes directly from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the unit circle!

# Formulas

## Primary Trigonometric Ratios

$$\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$$

$$\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$$

$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$$

## Reciprocal Identities

$$\csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)}$$

$$\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)}$$

$$\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)}$$

## Quotient Identity

$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$$

## Pythagorean Identity

$$\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$$

## Finding Missing Sides

If you know an angle $\theta$ and one side:

$$\text{opposite} = \text{hypotenuse} \times \sin(\theta)$$
$$\text{adjacent} = \text{hypotenuse} \times \cos(\theta)$$

# Examples

## Example 1: Finding Sine, Cosine, and Tangent

**Problem:** In a right triangle, the opposite side is 3, the adjacent side is 4, and the hypotenuse is 5. Find $\sin(\theta)$, $\cos(\theta)$, and $\tan(\theta)$.

**Solution:**
$$\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6$$

$$\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8$$

$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75$$

**Answers: $\sin(\theta) = 0.6$, $\cos(\theta) = 0.8$, $\tan(\theta) = 0.75$**

## Example 2: Finding a Missing Side

**Problem:** In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is 10 cm and one angle is 30°. Find the length of the side opposite to the 30° angle.

**Solution:**
Using $\sin(30°) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$:

$$\sin(30°) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{10}$$

We know $\sin(30°) = 0.5$:

$$0.5 = \frac{\text{opposite}}{10}$$
$$\text{opposite} = 10 \times 0.5 = 5$$

**Answer: The opposite side is 5 cm**

## Example 3: Finding an Angle

**Problem:** In a right triangle, the opposite side is 7 and the hypotenuse is 14. Find the angle $\theta$.

**Solution:**
$$\sin(\theta) = \frac{7}{14} = 0.5$$

Using inverse sine:
$$\theta = \sin^{-1}(0.5) = 30°$$

**Answer: $\theta = 30°$**

## Example 4: Using Tangent

**Problem:** A ladder leans against a wall. The base of the ladder is 6 feet from the wall, and the ladder makes a 60° angle with the ground. How high up the wall does the ladder reach?

**Solution:**
Let $h$ = height on the wall

Using $\tan(60°) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$:

$$\tan(60°) = \frac{h}{6}$$

We know $\tan(60°) = \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732$:

$$1.732 = \frac{h}{6}$$
$$h = 6 \times 1.732 = 10.39$$

**Answer: The ladder reaches approximately 10.4 feet up the wall**

## Example 5: Verifying the Pythagorean Identity

**Problem:** For $\theta = 30°$, verify that $\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$

**Solution:**
$$\sin(30°) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \cos(30°) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

$$\sin^2(30°) + \cos^2(30°) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2$$

$$= \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1$$ ✓

**The identity is verified!**

## Example 6: Real-World Application - Finding Height

**Problem:** From a point 100 meters from the base of a building, the angle of elevation to the top of the building is 35°. How tall is the building?

**Solution:**
Let $h$ = height of building

Using $\tan(35°) = \frac{h}{100}$:

$$\tan(35°) = \frac{h}{100}$$

Using a calculator, $\tan(35°) \approx 0.7002$:

$$0.7002 = \frac{h}{100}$$
$$h = 100 \times 0.7002 = 70.02$$

**Answer: The building is approximately 70 meters tall**
