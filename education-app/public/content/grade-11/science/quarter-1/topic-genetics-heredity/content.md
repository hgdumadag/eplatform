# Genetics & Heredity

## Introduction

Have you ever wondered why you have your mother's eyes or your father's hair color? The answer lies in genetics, the fascinating science of heredity and variation. Genetics explains how traits are passed from parents to offspring through genes, the fundamental units of inheritance.

From Gregor Mendel's pioneering experiments with pea plants in the 1860s to modern DNA sequencing, genetics has revolutionized our understanding of life itself. In this lesson, we'll explore the principles that govern inheritance, the structure of DNA, and how genetic variation makes each organism unique.

## Main Content

### 1. Mendel's Laws of Inheritance

Gregor Mendel, the "Father of Genetics," discovered fundamental principles of inheritance through careful experiments with pea plants.

#### Law of Segregation
Each parent has two copies of each gene (alleles), and these alleles separate during gamete (sex cell) formation. Each gamete receives only one allele from each gene pair.

#### Law of Independent Assortment
Genes for different traits are inherited independently of each other (applies to genes on different chromosomes).

#### Law of Dominance
In a heterozygous condition, the dominant allele will be expressed in the phenotype, masking the recessive allele.

### 2. Key Genetic Terms

**Gene**: A segment of DNA that codes for a specific trait

**Allele**: Different versions of the same gene (e.g., tall vs. short)

**Genotype**: The genetic makeup of an organism (the alleles present)

**Phenotype**: The observable characteristics (physical appearance)

**Homozygous**: Having two identical alleles for a gene (AA or aa)

**Heterozygous**: Having two different alleles for a gene (Aa)

**Dominant**: An allele that is expressed when present (represented by capital letter, e.g., A)

**Recessive**: An allele that is only expressed when two copies are present (represented by lowercase letter, e.g., a)

### 3. Punnett Squares

Punnett squares are diagrams used to predict the genotypes and phenotypes of offspring from genetic crosses.

#### Monohybrid Cross
A cross involving one trait with two alleles.

Example: Crossing two heterozygous tall plants (Tt × Tt)

```
       T    t
   T  TT   Tt
   t  Tt   tt
```

**Results:**
- Genotypic ratio: 1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt
- Phenotypic ratio: 3 tall : 1 short
- Probability: 75% tall, 25% short

#### Dihybrid Cross
A cross involving two different traits.

For two traits (e.g., seed shape and color), the genotypic and phenotypic ratios become more complex, following a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio for two heterozygous parents.

### 4. DNA Structure

**DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)** is the molecule that carries genetic information.

#### Structure:
- Double helix (twisted ladder shape)
- Two complementary strands
- Made of nucleotides

#### Nucleotide Components:
1. Sugar (deoxyribose)
2. Phosphate group
3. Nitrogenous base

#### The Four Bases:
- **Adenine (A)** pairs with **Thymine (T)**
- **Guanine (G)** pairs with **Cytosine (C)**

Base pairing rule: A-T and G-C (complementary base pairing)

### 5. Probability in Genetics

Genetic inheritance follows probability rules:

$$P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{total number of possible outcomes}}$$

For independent events (following the law of independent assortment):

$$P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)$$

### 6. Types of Inheritance Patterns

#### Complete Dominance
One allele completely masks the other (Mendel's pea plants)

#### Incomplete Dominance
Heterozygous phenotype is intermediate (e.g., red × white flowers = pink)

#### Codominance
Both alleles are fully expressed (e.g., AB blood type)

#### Sex-Linked Traits
Genes located on sex chromosomes (X or Y), often showing different inheritance patterns in males and females

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Simple Monohybrid Cross

**Problem:** In pea plants, tall (T) is dominant over short (t). Cross a homozygous tall plant (TT) with a short plant (tt). What are the genotypes and phenotypes of the F₁ generation?

**Solution:**

Parent genotypes: TT × tt

```
       T    T
   t  Tt   Tt
   t  Tt   Tt
```

**Results:**
- All offspring: Tt (100%)
- Genotype: 100% Tt (heterozygous)
- Phenotype: 100% tall

**Answer:** All F₁ offspring will be heterozygous tall (Tt).

### Example 2: Heterozygous Cross

**Problem:** Two heterozygous plants for flower color are crossed, where purple (P) is dominant over white (p). What percentage of offspring will have white flowers?

**Solution:**

Parent genotypes: Pp × Pp

```
       P    p
   P  PP   Pp
   p  Pp   pp
```

**Results:**
- PP: 1 (25%)
- Pp: 2 (50%)
- pp: 1 (25%)
- Purple flowers: 75% (PP and Pp)
- White flowers: 25% (pp)

**Answer:** 25% of offspring will have white flowers.

### Example 3: Probability Calculation

**Problem:** A heterozygous tall (Tt) plant is crossed with a short (tt) plant. What is the probability that the first two offspring will both be tall?

**Solution:**

Parent genotypes: Tt × tt

```
       T    t
   t  Tt   tt
   t  Tt   tt
```

Probability of one tall offspring: 2/4 = 1/2 = 0.5

For two independent events:
$$P(\text{both tall}) = P(\text{first tall}) \times P(\text{second tall})$$
$$P(\text{both tall}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 = 25\%$$

**Answer:** There is a 25% probability that both offspring will be tall.

### Example 4: DNA Complementary Strand

**Problem:** Given a DNA strand with the sequence 5'-ATGCGTA-3', what is the complementary strand?

**Solution:**

Using base pairing rules:
- A pairs with T
- T pairs with A
- G pairs with C
- C pairs with G

Original strand: 5'-ATGCGTA-3'
Complementary: 3'-TACGCAT-5'

**Answer:** The complementary strand is 3'-TACGCAT-5'.

### Example 5: Multiple Trait Probability

**Problem:** In a dihybrid cross, a plant heterozygous for both tall height (T) and purple flowers (P) is crossed with itself (TtPp × TtPp). What is the probability of offspring that are tall with purple flowers?

**Solution:**

Treat each trait independently:

For height (Tt × Tt):
- Probability of tall (T_): 3/4

For flower color (Pp × Pp):
- Probability of purple (P_): 3/4

Using the multiplication rule:
$$P(\text{tall and purple}) = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{16} = 0.5625 = 56.25\%$$

**Answer:** 9/16 or 56.25% of offspring will be tall with purple flowers.
