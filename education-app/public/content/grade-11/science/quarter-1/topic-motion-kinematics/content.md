# Motion & Kinematics

## Introduction

Welcome to the fascinating world of motion! Kinematics is the branch of physics that describes the motion of objects without considering the forces that cause the motion. Whether it's a car accelerating on a highway, a ball thrown into the air, or a rocket launching into space, understanding kinematics helps us predict and analyze how objects move through space and time.

In this lesson, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of displacement, velocity, and acceleration, and learn how to apply powerful kinematic equations to solve real-world problems.

## Main Content

### 1. Fundamental Concepts

#### Displacement
**Displacement** ($\Delta x$) is the change in position of an object. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.

$$\Delta x = x_f - x_i$$

where $x_f$ is the final position and $x_i$ is the initial position.

#### Velocity
**Velocity** ($v$) is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. Average velocity is given by:

$$v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$

**Instantaneous velocity** is the velocity at a specific moment in time, represented as:

$$v = \frac{dx}{dt}$$

#### Acceleration
**Acceleration** ($a$) is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time:

$$a_{avg} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_f - v_i}{\Delta t}$$

Acceleration can be positive (speeding up) or negative (slowing down, also called deceleration).

### 2. The Kinematic Equations

For motion with constant acceleration, we have four fundamental equations:

1. **Velocity-Time Equation:**
$$v_f = v_i + at$$

2. **Displacement-Time Equation:**
$$\Delta x = v_i t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$

3. **Velocity-Displacement Equation:**
$$v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\Delta x$$

4. **Average Velocity Equation:**
$$\Delta x = \frac{1}{2}(v_i + v_f)t$$

Where:
- $v_i$ = initial velocity
- $v_f$ = final velocity
- $a$ = acceleration (constant)
- $t$ = time
- $\Delta x$ = displacement

### 3. Motion Graphs

#### Position-Time Graphs
- The slope represents velocity
- A straight line indicates constant velocity
- A curved line indicates acceleration

#### Velocity-Time Graphs
- The slope represents acceleration
- The area under the curve represents displacement
- A horizontal line indicates constant velocity (zero acceleration)

#### Acceleration-Time Graphs
- The area under the curve represents change in velocity
- A horizontal line indicates constant acceleration

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Finding Final Velocity

**Problem:** A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at $3 \text{ m/s}^2$ for 8 seconds. What is its final velocity?

**Solution:**
- Given: $v_i = 0 \text{ m/s}$ (starts from rest), $a = 3 \text{ m/s}^2$, $t = 8 \text{ s}$
- Find: $v_f$
- Use equation: $v_f = v_i + at$

$$v_f = 0 + (3)(8) = 24 \text{ m/s}$$

**Answer:** The final velocity is $24 \text{ m/s}$.

### Example 2: Calculating Displacement

**Problem:** A cyclist traveling at $15 \text{ m/s}$ applies brakes and comes to rest in 5 seconds. How far does the cyclist travel during braking?

**Solution:**
- Given: $v_i = 15 \text{ m/s}$, $v_f = 0 \text{ m/s}$, $t = 5 \text{ s}$
- Find: $\Delta x$
- First, find acceleration: $a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t} = \frac{0 - 15}{5} = -3 \text{ m/s}^2$
- Use equation: $\Delta x = v_i t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$

$$\Delta x = (15)(5) + \frac{1}{2}(-3)(5)^2 = 75 - 37.5 = 37.5 \text{ m}$$

**Answer:** The cyclist travels $37.5 \text{ m}$ before stopping.

### Example 3: Free Fall Motion

**Problem:** A stone is dropped from a cliff 80 m high. How long does it take to reach the ground? (Use $g = 10 \text{ m/s}^2$)

**Solution:**
- Given: $v_i = 0 \text{ m/s}$, $\Delta x = 80 \text{ m}$, $a = g = 10 \text{ m/s}^2$
- Find: $t$
- Use equation: $\Delta x = v_i t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$

$$80 = 0 + \frac{1}{2}(10)t^2$$
$$80 = 5t^2$$
$$t^2 = 16$$
$$t = 4 \text{ s}$$

**Answer:** The stone takes $4 \text{ s}$ to reach the ground.

### Example 4: Using the Velocity-Displacement Equation

**Problem:** A train moving at $20 \text{ m/s}$ accelerates at $2 \text{ m/s}^2$ over a distance of 150 m. What is its final velocity?

**Solution:**
- Given: $v_i = 20 \text{ m/s}$, $a = 2 \text{ m/s}^2$, $\Delta x = 150 \text{ m}$
- Find: $v_f$
- Use equation: $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\Delta x$

$$v_f^2 = (20)^2 + 2(2)(150) = 400 + 600 = 1000$$
$$v_f = \sqrt{1000} = 31.62 \text{ m/s}$$

**Answer:** The final velocity is approximately $31.62 \text{ m/s}$.

### Example 5: Multi-Step Problem

**Problem:** A car accelerates from $10 \text{ m/s}$ to $30 \text{ m/s}$ in 4 seconds.
a) What is the acceleration?
b) How far does it travel during this time?

**Solution:**

**Part a:**
- Given: $v_i = 10 \text{ m/s}$, $v_f = 30 \text{ m/s}$, $t = 4 \text{ s}$
- Use: $a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}$

$$a = \frac{30 - 10}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ m/s}^2$$

**Part b:**
- Use: $\Delta x = \frac{1}{2}(v_i + v_f)t$

$$\Delta x = \frac{1}{2}(10 + 30)(4) = \frac{1}{2}(40)(4) = 80 \text{ m}$$

**Answers:**
a) The acceleration is $5 \text{ m/s}^2$
b) The car travels $80 \text{ m}$

## Key Takeaways

1. **Displacement** is a vector quantity representing change in position, while **distance** is the total path length traveled.

2. **Velocity** is the rate of change of displacement; **speed** is the magnitude of velocity without direction.

3. **Acceleration** describes how quickly velocity changes over time and can be positive or negative.

4. The **four kinematic equations** apply only when acceleration is constant.

5. Always identify what information is given and what you need to find, then select the appropriate kinematic equation.

6. Pay attention to **signs**: positive usually indicates motion in one direction (e.g., upward, rightward), while negative indicates the opposite.

7. In **free fall problems**, acceleration due to gravity is $g = 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$ (or $10 \text{ m/s}^2$ for simplified calculations) directed downward.

8. **Motion graphs** provide visual representations that help analyze movement patterns and relationships between position, velocity, and acceleration.
