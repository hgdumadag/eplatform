      "question": "Read this sentence: 'The assignment was a piece of cake.' What type of figurative language is used?",
      "options": [
        "Simile",
        "Personification",
        "Metaphor",
        "Alliteration"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,

      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "How does setting function beyond simply providing time and place in a literary work?",
      "correctAnswer": "setting can establish mood, reflect characters' emotions, symbolize themes, create conflict, and influence character development",
      "explanation": "Setting is a powerful tool that can enhance atmosphere, mirror internal states, carry symbolic meaning, present obstacles, and shape characters' worldviews and choices. It's an integral part of the story's meaning, not just background.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,

      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "What is the difference between direct and indirect characterization?",
      "correctAnswer": "direct characterization explicitly states character traits, while indirect characterization reveals traits through actions, dialogue, thoughts, and interactions",
      "explanation": "Direct characterization tells readers about a character (e.g., 'John was brave'). Indirect characterization shows character traits through behavior, speech, and other means, allowing readers to draw their own conclusions (e.g., John running into a burning building).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Literary analysis focuses on interpretation and analysis, not retelling the story. While some context is necessary, extensive plot summary without analysis demonstrates poor understanding of the assignment's purpose.",

    {
      "id": "q8",
      "type": "short-answer",
