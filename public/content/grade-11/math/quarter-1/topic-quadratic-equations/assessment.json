        "$x = 9$ or $x = -2$"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Factoring gives $(x + 6)(x - 3) = 0$. Setting each factor to zero: $x + 6 = 0$ gives $x = -6$, and $x - 3 = 0$ gives $x = 3$.",

      "correctAnswer": "-3",
      "explanation": "Using $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$ with $a=1, b=-5, c=7$: $\\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(7) = 25 - 28 = -3$.",

      "correctAnswer": "false",
      "explanation": "When $\\Delta = 0$, the equation has exactly one repeated real root (or we say two equal roots), not two distinct roots. The parabola touches the x-axis at exactly one point.",

      "explanation": "The projectile hits the ground when $h = 0$: $-5t^2 + 20t = 0$. Factor: $-5t(t - 4) = 0$. This gives $t = 0$ (launch time) or $t = 4$ seconds (landing time).",
