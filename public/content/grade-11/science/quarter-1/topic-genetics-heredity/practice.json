    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "In pea plants, tall (T) is dominant over short (t). If a heterozygous tall plant (Tt) is crossed with a short plant (tt), what percentage of offspring will be tall?",
      "options": ["25%", "50%", "75%", "100%"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The cross Tt × tt produces: Tt, Tt, tt, tt. Two out of four (50%) will be tall (Tt).",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "A dominant allele is always more common in a population than a recessive allele.",
      "correctAnswer": "false",
      "explanation": "Dominance refers to how alleles are expressed in phenotype, not their frequency in a population. Recessive alleles can be more common.",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which DNA base pairs with Adenine (A)?",
      "options": ["Cytosine", "Guanine", "Thymine", "Uracil"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "In DNA, Adenine (A) always pairs with Thymine (T), and Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C).",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "type": "fill-in",
      "question": "An organism with two identical alleles for a trait (such as TT or tt) is called _______.",
      "correctAnswer": "homozygous",
      "explanation": "Homozygous means having two identical alleles. Heterozygous means having two different alleles.",
      "points": 15

    {
      "id": "q5",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Two heterozygous plants for purple flowers (Pp) are crossed. What is the expected phenotypic ratio of the offspring?",
      "options": ["1 purple : 1 white", "2 purple : 1 white", "3 purple : 1 white", "4 purple : 0 white"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Pp × Pp produces PP, Pp, Pp, pp. Three show purple phenotype (PP and Pp) and one shows white (pp), giving a 3:1 ratio.",
      "points": 15
    },
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Genotype refers to the physical appearance of an organism.",
      "correctAnswer": "false",
      "explanation": "Genotype refers to the genetic makeup (alleles present). Phenotype refers to the physical appearance or observable traits.",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q7",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "If the DNA sequence on one strand is 5'-GCTA-3', what is the complementary strand?",
      "options": ["5'-CGAT-3'", "3'-CGAT-5'", "5'-TACG-3'", "3'-TACG-5'"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Using base pairing (G-C, C-G, T-A, A-T): G pairs with C, C with G, T with A, A with T. The complementary strand runs antiparallel: 3'-CGAT-5'.",
      "points": 15

      "id": "q8",
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "A heterozygous black cat (Bb) is crossed with a homozygous white cat (bb). What is the probability that a kitten will be white?",
      "correctAnswer": "50% or 1/2 or 0.5",
      "explanation": "The cross Bb × bb produces Bb, Bb, bb, bb. Two out of four (50%) are white (bb).",
