    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What type of energy does a moving bicycle have?",
      "options": ["Potential energy", "Kinetic energy", "Chemical energy", "Sound energy"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. A moving bicycle has kinetic energy because it is in motion.",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Energy can be created and destroyed.",
      "correctAnswer": "false",
      "explanation": "According to the Law of Conservation of Energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed—it can only change from one form to another.",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which force pulls objects toward the Earth?",
      "options": ["Friction", "Magnetism", "Gravity", "Air resistance"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Gravity is the force that pulls objects toward the center of the Earth, making things fall down.",
      "points": 15
    },

      "id": "q4",
      "type": "fill-in",
      "question": "A ball sitting on top of a hill has _______ energy.",
      "correctAnswer": "potential",
      "explanation": "Potential energy is stored energy based on position. The ball has potential energy because of its height on the hill.",
      "points": 15
    },

      "id": "q5",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What happens when two north poles of magnets are brought close together?",
      "options": ["They attract", "They repel", "They stick together", "Nothing happens"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Like poles (north-north or south-south) repel or push away from each other. Opposite poles attract.",
      "points": 15
    },
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Friction is a force that helps objects move faster.",
      "correctAnswer": "false",
      "explanation": "Friction opposes motion and slows objects down. It acts in the opposite direction of movement.",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q7",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "When you turn on a flashlight, electrical energy changes into what type of energy?",
      "options": ["Chemical energy", "Light energy", "Sound energy", "Kinetic energy"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A flashlight transforms electrical energy from batteries into light energy (and some heat energy).",

    {
      "id": "q8",
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "Name one force and describe what it does.",
      "correctAnswer": "Gravity pulls objects down, Friction slows things down, Magnetism attracts or repels magnets",
      "explanation": "Accept any correct force with an accurate description: Gravity (pulls down), Friction (slows motion), Magnetism (attracts/repels), Applied force (pushes/pulls objects).",
