      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "To convert $\\frac{3}{4}$ to a decimal, divide 3 by 4: $3 \\div 4 = 0.75$.",

      "correctAnswer": "1/2",
      "explanation": "0.5 means 5 tenths: $\\frac{5}{10}$. Simplifying by dividing both by 5: $\\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}$.",

      "correctAnswer": "true",
      "explanation": "Comparing 0.70 and 0.65: Both have 6 or 7 in tenths place. 7 tenths > 6 tenths, so 0.7 > 0.65 is true.",
