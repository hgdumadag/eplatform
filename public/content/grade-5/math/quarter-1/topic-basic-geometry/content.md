# Basic Geometry

## Introduction

Welcome to the amazing world of geometry! Geometry is all around us - in the buildings we live in, the devices we use, the art we create, and even in nature. The word "geometry" comes from Greek words meaning "earth measurement," and people have been using geometry for thousands of years to build, design, and create.

In this lesson, you'll learn about shapes, angles, lines, and how to measure important features like perimeter and area. Get ready to see math in a whole new way!

## Points, Lines, and Angles

### Points, Lines, and Line Segments

- A **point** is an exact location in space (marked with a dot)
- A **line** extends forever in both directions (has arrows on both ends)
- A **line segment** has two endpoints (has dots at both ends)
- A **ray** starts at one point and extends forever in one direction

### Types of Lines

- **Parallel lines** never meet (like railroad tracks)
- **Perpendicular lines** meet at right angles (like the corner of a square)
- **Intersecting lines** cross each other

### Angles

An **angle** is formed when two rays share a common endpoint called the vertex.

We measure angles in **degrees** (°).

#### Types of Angles

1. **Right Angle**: Exactly 90° (like the corner of a square)
2. **Acute Angle**: Less than 90° (sharp angle)
3. **Obtuse Angle**: Greater than 90° but less than 180° (wide angle)
4. **Straight Angle**: Exactly 180° (a straight line)

## 2D Shapes (Polygons)

A **polygon** is a closed figure made of straight line segments.

### Common Polygons

1. **Triangle**: 3 sides
2. **Quadrilateral**: 4 sides (includes squares, rectangles, and more)
3. **Pentagon**: 5 sides
4. **Hexagon**: 6 sides
5. **Octagon**: 8 sides

### Special Quadrilaterals

- **Square**: 4 equal sides, 4 right angles
- **Rectangle**: Opposite sides equal, 4 right angles
- **Parallelogram**: Opposite sides parallel and equal
- **Rhombus**: 4 equal sides, opposite angles equal
- **Trapezoid**: Exactly one pair of parallel sides

## Perimeter

The **perimeter** is the distance around the outside of a shape. To find perimeter, add up all the side lengths.

### Perimeter Formulas

**Rectangle:**
$$P = 2l + 2w$$
or
$$P = 2(l + w)$$

where $l$ = length and $w$ = width

**Square:**
$$P = 4s$$

where $s$ = side length

**Triangle or Any Polygon:**
$$P = \text{sum of all sides}$$

## Area

The **area** is the amount of space inside a shape. We measure area in square units (like square inches, square feet, or square meters).

### Area Formulas

**Rectangle:**
$$A = l \times w$$

where $l$ = length and $w$ = width

**Square:**
$$A = s \times s = s^2$$

where $s$ = side length

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Identifying Angles

**Problem:** Classify these angles:
- Angle A measures 45°
- Angle B measures 90°
- Angle C measures 120°

**Solution:**

- Angle A = 45° → **Acute angle** (less than 90°)
- Angle B = 90° → **Right angle** (exactly 90°)
- Angle C = 120° → **Obtuse angle** (greater than 90° but less than 180°)

**Answer:** A is acute, B is right, C is obtuse

### Example 2: Finding Perimeter of a Rectangle

**Problem:** A rectangular garden is 8 meters long and 5 meters wide. What is the perimeter?

**Solution:**

Using the formula $P = 2l + 2w$:
$$P = 2(8) + 2(5)$$
$$P = 16 + 10$$
$$P = 26 \text{ meters}$$

**Answer:** The perimeter is 26 meters.

### Example 3: Finding Perimeter of a Square

**Problem:** A square has sides that are 6 cm long. What is the perimeter?

**Solution:**

Using the formula $P = 4s$:
$$P = 4 \times 6$$
$$P = 24 \text{ cm}$$

**Answer:** The perimeter is 24 cm.

### Example 4: Finding Area of a Rectangle

**Problem:** A rectangular poster is 12 inches long and 8 inches wide. What is the area?

**Solution:**

Using the formula $A = l \times w$:
$$A = 12 \times 8$$
$$A = 96 \text{ square inches}$$

**Answer:** The area is 96 square inches.

### Example 5: Finding Area of a Square

**Problem:** A square tile has sides that are 4 inches long. What is the area?

**Solution:**

Using the formula $A = s^2$:
$$A = 4 \times 4$$
$$A = 16 \text{ square inches}$$

**Answer:** The area is 16 square inches.

### Example 6: Real-World Problem

**Problem:** Mrs. Johnson wants to put a fence around her rectangular yard that is 20 feet long and 15 feet wide. How much fencing does she need? If she also wants to put grass in the yard, and grass costs $2 per square foot, how much will the grass cost?

**Solution:**

**Part 1: Finding the perimeter (fencing needed)**
$$P = 2l + 2w = 2(20) + 2(15)$$
$$P = 40 + 30 = 70 \text{ feet}$$

**Part 2: Finding the area (grass needed)**
$$A = l \times w = 20 \times 15$$
$$A = 300 \text{ square feet}$$

**Part 3: Calculating grass cost**
$$\text{Cost} = 300 \times \$2 = \$600$$

**Answer:** Mrs. Johnson needs 70 feet of fencing, and the grass will cost $600.

## Perimeter vs. Area

It's important to understand the difference:

| Perimeter | Area |
|-----------|------|
| Distance around | Space inside |
| Measured in units (feet, meters, etc.) | Measured in square units (square feet, square meters, etc.) |
| Like a fence around a yard | Like grass covering a yard |
| Add all sides | Multiply length × width |

**Key Point:** Two shapes can have the same perimeter but different areas, or the same area but different perimeters!

**Example:**
- Rectangle A: 6 × 2 → Perimeter = 16, Area = 12
- Rectangle B: 4 × 4 (square) → Perimeter = 16, Area = 16
- Both have the same perimeter (16) but different areas!

## Properties of Shapes

### Triangle Properties
- Has 3 sides and 3 angles
- The sum of all angles = 180°
- Types: equilateral (all sides equal), isosceles (2 sides equal), scalene (no sides equal)

### Quadrilateral Properties
- Has 4 sides and 4 angles
- The sum of all angles = 360°
- Many different types based on side lengths and angles

### Circle (Special Shape)
- Not a polygon (no straight sides)
- Perfectly round
- All points are the same distance from the center
- That distance is called the **radius**

## Real-Life Applications

1. **Carpeting a room**: Need to calculate area
2. **Building a fence**: Need to calculate perimeter
3. **Wrapping a gift**: Need to consider area and perimeter
4. **Painting a wall**: Need to calculate area
5. **Running around a track**: Following the perimeter
6. **Gardening**: Planning space using area

## Key Takeaways

1. **Angles** are measured in degrees and can be acute, right, obtuse, or straight
2. **Polygons** are closed shapes with straight sides
3. **Perimeter** is the distance around a shape (add all sides)
4. **Area** is the space inside a shape (for rectangles: length × width)
5. **Rectangle perimeter**: $P = 2l + 2w$ or $P = 2(l + w)$
6. **Rectangle area**: $A = l \times w$
7. **Square perimeter**: $P = 4s$
8. **Square area**: $A = s^2$
9. **Parallel lines** never meet; **perpendicular lines** meet at right angles
10. **Always include units** in your answer (feet, meters, square inches, etc.)

## Tips for Success

- Draw pictures to visualize problems
- Label all sides with their measurements
- Double-check that you're using the right formula
- Remember: perimeter uses regular units, area uses square units
- Check if your answer makes sense (area should be bigger than perimeter for most shapes)
