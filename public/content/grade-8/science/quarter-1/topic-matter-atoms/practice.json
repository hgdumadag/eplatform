    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which subatomic particle has a positive charge?",
      "options": ["Electron", "Neutron", "Proton", "Nucleus"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Protons are positively charged particles located in the nucleus. Electrons are negative, and neutrons have no charge.",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "The atomic number of an element equals the number of neutrons in its nucleus.",
      "correctAnswer": "false",
      "explanation": "The atomic number equals the number of protons, not neutrons. Mass number = protons + neutrons.",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "An atom has 17 protons and 18 neutrons. What is its mass number?",
      "options": ["1", "17", "18", "35"],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Mass number = protons + neutrons = 17 + 18 = 35.",
      "points": 15
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "type": "fill-in",
      "question": "Matter that has a definite shape and volume is in the _______ state.",
      "correctAnswer": "solid",
      "explanation": "Solids have both definite shape and volume because particles are tightly packed and only vibrate in place.",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which of the following is a compound?",
      "options": ["Oxygen (O₂)", "Gold (Au)", "Water (H₂O)", "Helium (He)"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Water (H₂O) is a compound because it contains two different elements (hydrogen and oxygen) chemically bonded. The others are elements.",
      "points": 15
    },
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Electrons are found in the nucleus of an atom.",
      "correctAnswer": "false",
      "explanation": "Electrons orbit the nucleus in electron shells or clouds. The nucleus contains only protons and neutrons.",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q7",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the density of an object with a mass of 80 g and a volume of 20 cm³?",
      "options": ["2 g/cm³", "4 g/cm³", "60 g/cm³", "100 g/cm³"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Density = mass/volume = 80 g ÷ 20 cm³ = 4 g/cm³.",
      "points": 15

      "id": "q8",
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "How many total atoms are in one molecule of carbon dioxide (CO₂)?",
      "correctAnswer": "3 or three",
      "explanation": "CO₂ has 1 carbon atom and 2 oxygen atoms, for a total of 3 atoms.",
