    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which particle has the smallest mass?",
      "options": ["Proton", "Neutron", "Electron", "All have equal mass"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Electrons have approximately 1/2000 the mass of protons and neutrons, making them by far the lightest subatomic particle.",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "In a neutral atom, the number of protons equals the number of electrons.",
      "correctAnswer": "true",
      "explanation": "A neutral atom has no net charge, which requires equal numbers of positive protons and negative electrons.",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Sodium has an atomic number of 11 and a mass number of 23. How many neutrons does it have?",
      "options": ["11", "12", "23", "34"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Neutrons = mass number - atomic number = 23 - 11 = 12 neutrons.",
      "points": 15
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "type": "fill-in",
      "question": "The state of matter with no definite shape or volume is called a _______.",
      "correctAnswer": "gas",
      "explanation": "Gases have particles that are far apart and move freely, so they take the shape and volume of their container.",
      "points": 10
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which of the following is a mixture, not a pure substance?",
      "options": ["Salt (NaCl)", "Air", "Water (H₂O)", "Iron (Fe)"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Air is a mixture of gases (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc.). The others are pure substances—NaCl and H₂O are compounds, Fe is an element.",
      "points": 15

      "id": "q6",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Metals are found on the right side of the periodic table.",
      "correctAnswer": "false",
      "explanation": "Metals are found on the left side and center of the periodic table. Nonmetals are on the right side.",
      "points": 10

      "id": "q7",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "How many hydrogen atoms are in one molecule of ammonia (NH₃)?",
      "options": ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The subscript 3 in NH₃ indicates there are 3 hydrogen atoms bonded to 1 nitrogen atom.",

    {
      "id": "q8",
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "An object has a volume of 25 cm³ and a density of 3 g/cm³. What is its mass?",
      "correctAnswer": "75 g or 75 grams",
      "explanation": "Mass = density × volume = 3 g/cm³ × 25 cm³ = 75 g.",
